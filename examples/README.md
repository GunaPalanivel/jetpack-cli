# Examples Directory

This directory contains example outputs and reference materials for Jetpack CLI.

## Contents

### `generated-docs/`
Real documentation generated by Jetpack's documentation generator from `sample-manifest.yaml`.

This serves as a reference example showing:
- 9 markdown documentation files organized by section
- Stripe-style documentation (short, focused, code-first)
- Context-aware content based on installation state
- Platform-specific instructions (Windows/macOS/Linux)

**Sections:**
- `getting-started/` - Quickstart guide and prerequisites
- `setup/` - Dependencies, configuration, and environment setup
- `troubleshooting/` - Common issues and verification failure fixes
- `verification/` - Health checks and manual testing procedures

### `sample-manifest.yaml`
The `.onboard.yaml` manifest file used to generate the example documentation.

Demonstrates:
- Full Phase 7 documentation configuration
- Documentation section with custom output directory
- All supported manifest features (dependencies, setup steps, verification, SSH, Git)

## Usage

Developers can:
1. Review `generated-docs/` to see what documentation looks like
2. Use `sample-manifest.yaml` as a template for their own projects
3. Run integration tests that generate similar output (excluded via `.gitignore`)

## Regenerating Examples

To regenerate the example documentation:

```bash
# Run the integration test (generates to test-docs-output/)
node tests/integration-docs.test.js

# Or generate manually using the sample manifest
jetpack init file://./examples/sample-manifest.yaml
```
